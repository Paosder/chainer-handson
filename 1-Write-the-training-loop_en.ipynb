    "# How to write a training loop in Chainer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook session we will learn how to train a deep neural network to classify hand-written digits using the popular MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 50000 training examples and 10000 test examples. Each example contains a 28x28 greyscale image and a corresponding class label for the digit. Since the digits 0-9 are used, there are 10 class labels. \n",

However, we think it is good for first-time users to understand how the training process works before using the `Trainer` feature. Even advanced users might sometimes want to write their own training loop and so we will explain how to do so here. The complete training process consists of the following steps:\n",

    "## 3. Define the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's define a neural network that we will train to classify the MNIST images. For simplicity, we will use a fully-connected network with three layers. We will set each hidden layer to have 100 units and set the output layer to have 10 units, corresponding to the 10 class labels for the MNIST digits 0-9. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first briefly explain `Link`, `Function`, `Chain`, and `Variable` which are the basic components used for defining and running a model in Chainer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Link` and `Function`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chainer, each layer of a neural network is decomposed into one of two broad types of functions (actually, they are function objects): 'Link' and 'Function'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** `Function` is a function without learnable parameters**\n",
    "- ** `Link` is a function that conatins (learnable) parameters** We can think of `Link` as wrapping a `Function` to give it parameters. That is, `Link` will contain the parameters and when it is called, it will also call a corresponding `Function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then describe a model by implementing code the performs the \"forward pass\" computations. This code will call various links and chains (recall that `Link` and `Chain` are callable objects). Chainer will take care of the \"backward pass\" automatically and so we do not need to worry about that unless we want to write some custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For examples of links, see the 'chainer.links' module.\n",
    "- For examples of functions, see the 'chainer.functions' module.\n",
    "- For example, see the `Linear` link, which wraps the `linear` function to give it weight and bias parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start using them, we first need to import the modules as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    import chainer.links as L\n",
    "    import chainer.functions as F\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "The Chainer convention is to use `L` for links and `F` for functions, like 'L.Convolution2D(...)' or 'F.relu(...)'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Chain`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Chain` is a class that can hold multiple links and/or functions. It is a subclass of `Link` and so it is also a `Link`. \n",
    "- This means that a chain can contain parameters, which are the parameters of any links that it deeply contains.\n",
    "- In this way, `Chain` allows us to construct models with a potentially deep hierarchy of functions and links.\n",
    "- It is often convinient to use a single chain that contains all of the layers (other chains, links, and functions) of the model. This is because we will need to optimize the model's parameters during training and if all of the parameters are contained by a single chain, it turns out to be straightfoward to pass these parameters into an optimizer (which we describe in more detail below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Variable`\n",
    "In Chainer, both the activations (that is, the inputs and outputs of function and links) and the model parameters are instances of the `Variable` class. A `Variable` holds two arrays: a `data` array that contains the values that are read/written during the forward pass (or the parameter values), and a `grad` array that contains the corresponding gradients that will are computed during the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Variable` can potentially contain two types of arrays as well, depending whether the array resides in CPU or GPU memory. By default, the CPU is used and these will be Numpy arrays. However, it is possible to move or create these arrays on the GPU as well, in which case they will be CuPy arrays. Fortunately, CuPy uses an API that is nearly identical to Numpy. This is convinient because in addition to making it easier for users to learn (there is almost nothing to learn if you are already familiar with Numpy), it often allows us to reuse the same code for both Numpy and CuPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create our model as a subclass of 'Chain' \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create our model be writing a new subclass of `Chain`. The two main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any links (possiblye also including other chains) that we wish to call during the forward computation of our chain must first be supplied to the chain's `__init__` method. After the `__init__` method has been called, these links will then be accessable as attributes of our chain object. This means that we also need to provide the attribute name that we want to use for each link that is supplied. We do this by providing the attribute name and corresponding link object as keyword arguments to `__init__`, as we will do in the `MLP` chain below.\n",
    "2. We need to define a `__call__` method that allows our chain to be called like a function. This method takes one or more `Variable` objects as input (that is, the input activations) and returns one or more `Variable` objects. This method executes the forward pass of the model by calling any of the links that we supplied to `__init__` earlier as well as any functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only the links need to be supplied to `__init__`. This is because they contain parameters. Since functions do not contain any parameters, they can be called in `__call__` without having to supply them to the chain beforehand. For example, we can use a function such as `F.relu` by simply calling it in `__call__` but a link such as `L.Linear` would need to first be supplied to the chain's `__init__` in order to call it in `__call__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide that we want to call a link in a chain after `__init__` has already been called, we can use the `add_link` method of `Chain` to add a new link at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chainer, the Python code that implements the forward computation code itself represents the model. In other words, we can conceptually think of the computation graph for our model being constructed dynamically as this forward computation code executes. This allows Chainer to describe networks in which different computations can be performed in each iteration, such as branched networks, intuitively and with a high degree a flexibiity. This is the key feature of Chainer that we call **Define-by-Run**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run a model on GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Link` and `Chain` classes have a `to_gpu` method that takes a GPU id argument specifying which GPU to use. This method sends all of the model parameters to GPU memory.\n",
    "- By default, the CPU is used.\n"

When 'None' is passed as the first argument, this allows the number of necessary input units (`n_input`) and also the size of the weight and bias parameters to be automatically determined and computed at runtime during the first forward pass. We call this feature `parameter shape placeholder`. This can be a very helpful feature when defining deep neural network models, since it would often be tedious to manually determine these input sizes. \n",

    "## 5. Write the training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We now show how to write the training loop. Since we are working on a digit classification problem, we will use `softmax_cross_entropy` as the loss function for the optimizer to minimize. For other types of problems, such as regression models, other loss functions might be more appropriate. See the Chainer documentation for detailed information on the various loss functions that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our training loop will be structured as follows. We will first get a mini-batch of examples from the training dataset. We will then feed the batch into our model by calling or model (a `Chain` object) like a function. This will execute the forward-pass code that we wrote for the chain's `__call__` method that we wrote above. This will cause the model to output class label predictions that we supply to the loss function along with the true (that is, target) values. The loss function will output the loss as a `Variable` object. We then clear any previous gradients and perform the backward pass by calling the `backward` method on the loss variable which computes the parameter gradients. We need to clear the gradients first because the `backward` method accumulates gradients instead of overwriting the previous values. Since the optimizer already was given a reference to the model, it already has access to the parameters and the newly-computed gradients and so we can now call the `update` method of the optimizer which will update the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you might be wondering how calling `backward` on the loss variable could possibly compute the gradients for all of the model parameters. This works as follows. First recall that all activation and parameter arrays in the model are instances of `Variable`. During the forward pass, as each function is called on its inputs, we save references in each output variable that refer to the function that created it and its input variables. In this way, by the time the final loss variable is computed, it actually contains backward references that lead all the way back to the input variables of the model. That is, the loss variable contains a representation of the entire computational graph of the model, which is recomputed each time the forward pass is performed. By following these backward references from the loss variable, each function as a `backward` method that gets called to compute any parameter gradients. Thus, by the time the end of the backward graph is reached (at the input variables of the model), all parameter gradients have been computed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there are four steps in single training loop iteration as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain and pass a mini-batch of example images into the model and obtain the output digit predictions `prediction_train`. \n",
    "2. Compute the loss function, giving it the predicted labels from the output of our model and also the true \"target\" label values.\n",
    "3. Clear any previous gradients and call the backward method of 'Variable' to compute the parameter gradients for the model.  \n",
    "4. Call the 'update' method of Optimizer, which performs one optimization step and updates all of the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above steps, it is good to occasionally check the performance of our model on a validation and/or test set. This allows us to observe how well it can generalize to new data and also check whether it is overfitting. The code below checks the performance on the test set at the end of each epoch. The code has the same structure as the training code except that no backpropagation is performed and we also compute the accuracy on the test set using the `F.accuracy` function.\n",
